‘The complaints ’-against the inmates, as will bc seen, of not a very serious Ἰ
nature—‘relate 101 the most part to certain anticipations by some 01 the more

And newa 0011111111101 the part 01 the Roman Catholics
which is at the same time a serious accusation :-—

‘In estimating the case with which se many venerable monasterias were
overthrown, 11 must be borne in mirri 11111 101 some years previous to 111111·
final suppression, many steps had been taken by those in power 10 render that
suppression more easy. One of these, and perhaps the chief, was the appoint-
ment by the (101111 01 compliant and suborned men, already apostates at heart,
10 highest positione in the religious houses. No one uvas more prominent 11
this disgraccful intrigue then the highest eeclesiastical authority 111 the
kingdom, the primate Cranmeu’

As a proof 01 this, D. Weidon1 instances the ease 01 a
man who was recommended for a vacaney, aud 111101111-
'in an introductory letter quoted—said to be ς11111110111111,
and as ready 10 sch forward his prince's causes as noman more
01 his coat’ (1538). And 1111 1111 Professor Brewer, a Protestanh
histor-ian 01 Henry VHI2‚ has an admission bearing on this
subject, when he says: (Nothing) . . . . ‘wan-anus) us in
believing that the era preceding the Reformation was more
corrupt than that which succeeded 11.’

We now understand the preamble 01 the Act 27 Henry VIH,
inti'ded ⁶ An act 0010111111Ἰ the suppression or Dissohrtion 01

and 10 his Heirs for ever.
