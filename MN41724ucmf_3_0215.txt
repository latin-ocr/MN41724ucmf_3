NOTES.

1. 5. freorfi. After this word there is a gap 111 1110 MS, so that
some letter or letters may have been there, which are now gone.
Read fi'eorfldlice.

l. 8. 'scriptoribus This reading, 101 which nearly all other codices
have voluntatibus. is supported not only by two 01 the Latin MSS.
(G. u), but also by the gloss.

2. 8. Above dicente, a little to the right, 1“1 is found in the MS. Ι
presunre it is the ending 0110090011111110111110111111 filled out by a
copyist in its proper place, and thus written twice.

3. 3. -eood, as gloss to (probhbe. The other texts have forlzvcffo
(Schro'er, Die Prosabearbeitungen, 2. 21), except S. (W. V. 5. 15111111οΙ1
gives beold. Neither 01 these suggestsa reading 101 our text. Possibly
the e is a inisreading for a t (which suggestion is fauoured by the
palaeographical eridence), and the gloss was ι1111010011. Ι arn happy to
acknowledge rny indebtedness to Professor Cos'yn, 01 Leiden, 101 this
arrd other suggestions.

3. 11. petrola, as gloss to perfluentem, is in itself undoubtedly right.
Only per (lineatum was wrongly taken as one word; see context.
Sinn'lar cases where a misreading 01 1110 MS. produced a wrong gloss—
wrong· so far as the context is concerned—are numerous. See eg.
steorte, as gloss to 011, which is wrong 101 ord (78. 1).

3. 16. Heortaou=hoouoha See Swect, Ο.Ε. T„ p. 185.

5. 10. de habitatore (MS. habitatorum), glossed by bo restrueretur..
The other texts haue ‘be beera capersana his corrumpente-ff [Schro'er.
Die Prosabearbeitungen, 4. 22). But the Winteney Version which is
independent 01 0111 text, lias ‘ be 10111 'zorrraaaye bis ecooaystoae ’ (7. 27).
That the original also had ccrcrtrozyora is made (at least) likely by the
MS. reading lecctitotororn 101 1011101011, which may be owing to the -am
01 the gloss. But whence 1110 101111 rozrnrazyora? To read roron'yaaurm
(see 111, 1. 11) is an easy way out 011110 difficulty, but scarcely the
right one. We niust hare very good reasons indeed 101 assuming·
that a commonet 101111 made 100111 101 a rarer one. Considering that
the earliest examples given by Koch (Il, p. 342, ξ 61), 01 participial
forms in -iap are from the A-text of Layamon’s Β1111.,1.0. about the
year 1200 (see ib.. p. 10), I should not dare to think that we had
here an early instance 0111, 11 this form stood alone in our text.
But we also find luteos glossed by leit-incy (SO. 101. There would not
