(of Johe fourhh chapter only) in MS. Tib. A. 3, fo. 103 (see
above, p. xxiv).

In ‘ohe MS. Tib. A. 3 (fo. 118, above, p¹ xxiv), our Latin bexb
occurs in an exceedingly corrupi sbahe. ‘Seahebque mendis‚'
jushly observes Schmidh (p. xiii). Gueranger, Schmidt,
Migne, elo, have, in ‘cheir edibions, largely deviabed from hhe
M S. readings, Lower down in hhis Inhroduchiom in §d 7 and8
of No. V, some remarks will be found bearing on 'che edihion
of hhe Latin berb, ho which I beg ho refer hhe reader. lh
will be seen from those, whab my posihion is with regard

principles bhere shahed have led me ho deviabe as lihhle

would make bhe texe absolutely unintelligible ho che ordinary
reader. No one will for a momenb feel doubbs as bo hhe

been banished from hhe hexb, bui Ι have been careful ho mark
