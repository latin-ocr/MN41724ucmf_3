this instance 11111001100100100 not sure as to the meaning 01 the
gloss 110011. But 11 we find monstrante glossed by srcytelnnpe (35. 3),
we may perhaps look upon 1110 others too, as evidencing a participle

lcannot leave the matter alone without going at sorne length

prevete be 1110 0011001 one, 01 whether we must continue 10 view it
with Prof. Max Mulier (Lectores 0111110 Scicnce 01 Language, Π) 00 0
‘corruption' 0101011001 substantive 111 the dative, we are alike struck
with the fact that 101 0 long time, down 10 Gower and Ghaucer, noy,
to early in the fifteenth century ², the 1011110 and, -end, -ing continue
1ο be found parallel 111 the same authors. Now, though a hundred
and eighty years more 01 parallelisrn may increase our wonder⁷ they
need not materially alter our view 01 the case.

Lct us now turn to our 1011, and 000 what the frequent occurrence 01
-enac by the side 01 -ende 101 1110 pres. parc, as well as 101 the ger-und
or participium necessitatis (lntrodN, ξ 89), gives usaright to conclude.
11 we may lay down anything‚ it will be this, that the ending
-cade has dwindled down into a combinaticn 01 0 00110111 vowel (cf

0101001011 which is symbolised by d. Now the only difference between
this 1011101100οᾶ11100 is that the dcntal 11000110 replaced by the
guttural nasal, which 1 denote by 11, surely 111 110011 110 very great
change, especially as analogues are by no 11100110 wanting. We must
look to vulgar speech for some 01 these analogues. An arpina bccornes
