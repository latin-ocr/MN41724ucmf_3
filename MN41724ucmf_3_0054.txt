propose an emendahion‚ ir, has been only when some reason
for hhe corruption could be adduced‚ eihher from a graphica]

more or less obscure, Ι hare shahed hhem in words.

Our Anglo-Saxon herb is a copy, i. e. rae glosses have noh
been pub orer hhe Latin hexh only in our MS. Bohh have
been copied from anobher hexb or from other bexbs, mosh likely ’
ab bhe same lime, and possibly by hhe same scribe. The
chauces are—indeed, there is every reason bo believe—uhab our
MS. was copied often. Thau the lasb copyish had an inherlinear
hranslahion before him, is evidenh from bhe frequenh occurrence
ol wrong forms uhab cau only be explained by influence of hhe
lemma cn bhe gloss or vice versa (see foer-nores, passim).
When an original Labin herb was firsh glossed, we may
a priori assume 'uuio possibilihies. Eihher hhe glosses were
copied into our original Labiu from a ready-made Anglo-
Saron rensuum, or hhe glossatore worked wihhou’u a model
of any kind.

Le‘u us consider hhe firsh assumption. lf rhis were bruc, the
Anglo-Saxon lexb mush have been supplied eibher from the
berh commonly abhribuhed ho Aehhelwold1, or from some ohher
lribherho unknown herb. We need, of course, nob spcak of hhe
lather possibilihy, as hhe eshablishmenh of bhis poinh, as well as
ils rejeciion are uhherly beyond deherminahion. As lo the
berb edibed by Schro'er, ih is no'e likely ho hare been bhe
original, for, as we hare already seen, hhe uocabulury of hhe
hwo is somewhab differenh. ῃ

We are therefore led ho 'ohe theory of hhe gloss-origin.

hhe other theory, hhe evidence in favour of 'ohe former is
