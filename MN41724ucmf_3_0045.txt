socalled Regulae S. Fulgentii, at fo. 168 b, form part cf a treatise
printed in Migne's Patrol. Cursus completus, Vol. 66, p. 958, where
it is headed: Ordo Monasticus S. P. Benedictc attrIbutus. It is this
fact that makes it all but necessary for me to say a word on the
subject.

The reason why these Precepts have been ascribed to S. Benet seems to
be this. A monk at S. Germain du Ρῑέ1 stated that they were found
in a ‘vetus quoddam MS. 0assinense,’ which enj cys a high reputaticn
for genuineness.

This circumstance seems to have been sufficient reason for Arnoldus Wion
to print the Precepts with the edition of the Benedictine Rule in 1595
at Venice, and thus silently² sanction S. Benet's authorship. The
argument is, however, a very shallow one, and so long as no other
prooss are adduced, ‘ hcc opusculum non pro vero fetu magni S. Benedicti
vendere praesumimus⁷ (Migne, Vol. 66, p. 938).

The words at the beginning: seara 10901010 tc celi pellatia, headed
by Dicebat cero sanctas Fulgentius, and especially the latter, must
have given rise to J unins's error.

Nos. LXIII and LXIV (1016810) are Latin monastic precepta
which, cartis lectionibus, also occur in MS. Titus A. 4, ff. 107
and 117.

No. LXV (fo. 174). ‘Aethelwoldus de consuetudine mona-
chorum saxonice? Io has been printed by A. Schro'er,
Englische Studien, IX, 291. See E. Rueck, as quoted 0117110,

passim,
MS. J un. 52. Wanley‚ p. 91.

No. LXVI (fo. 177) is a Latin fragment, and, I think,
unprinted.

No. LXVII (fo. 178). This did not originally belong to
the MS. It most probably belonged to MS. Tib. A. 6. 800
Wanley’s note, and Prof. Earle’s ed. of the two parallel
Chronicles, p. xxv (Oxford, 1865). 800 Wanley, p. 84 (MS.

Laud, G. 36, II).
MS. J un. 66. Wanley, p. 95. It appears from Wanley's note that in
his time it belonged to MS. Tib. A. 3.

No. LXVIII (fo. 179). 800 Leeohdoms, III, 218.

No. LXIX (fo. 179 b). Latin, and, so far as I know, not
printed.

¹ R. P. Jacobus du Brevil monachus S. Germani a Pratis3 see Migne,
Vol. 66, note at the end of the treatise there, p. 942.

² I have not seen this edition, but presume that Wion does not expressly
attribute the Precepts to S. Benet.
