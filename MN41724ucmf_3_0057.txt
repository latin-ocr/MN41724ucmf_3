but omitted the glosses' I am inclined to think that this
view is not correct. It must be admitted that the several
blunders—see the 011110111011110-101· which we must blame
one 01 111010 of the scribes, point to an inrperfectly legible
101111 at one time 0101011101. But isit likely that the gloss
should have been unintelligible so wholesale‚ ancl the puving
letters quite clear? Must we not 0 [111011 accept the fact
that the Latin text stood in need 01 comment? What could
have been the object 01 him who thus tried to transmute
the interlineari· translation into a more 01 less piaraphrastical
one? I do 1101 wish to lay undue stress 011 the fact that
the gloss-letters are in Latin characters, like the Latin
text, whereas the A.-S. text is natru'ally written in A.-S.
characters. Ι only sap tha-t, although it perhaps rema-ins an
open question, the liheliest thing seems to be, that we must
look upon the gloss-letters as ‘paving’ the Latin text.

At one time we find two gloss-letters over one Latin
word, not only where this is glossed by 1100 Anglo-Saxon
ones, but also where only one AL-S. rendering¹ is given. At
another, a few non-pared words may be seen 1110110111ηὲ-
between two sets 01 pared ones. Sometimes these non-paved
words nrust be taken into account when constr-iring the
sentence, whereas a little further on we may find an instance
where they need 1101 be taken into consideration. From this
it is clear that, whatever explanation we fall back upon to
solve the difficulty-and none 011101· but the one propounded
by Wanley seems plausible, or even possible-we must not
strain it; we must rather be content 10 apply the 1101001110-
what loosely3 for there can be no doubt that 0111 ‘paving'
letters have suffered by the frequent transcribing which 0111
tent has undergone. In consequence 01 this we may expect:—

a. Letters to have been put over the wrong words;

β. Letters 1101 10 have been transcribecl 3

γ. Letters to hare been misunderstood as part 01 gloss-

words, which in reality are nothing but gloss-lette1·s;
