against the constancy with which larem obtains. On the
whole, Reimann (Die Sprache, etc, cp. 664, p. 36)‚—-who
assumes lalpeoo to be a twelfth century neologism,-see1ns
to me most likely to hare hit the mark.

Original [lt is represented by col in aoclrlcttao.(21. 15),
ſs is written f in atrefhyrrc (55. 5), a very probable phonetic
interchang'e. ’

b 53. s. S is assirnilated to t in Mettica (33. 3), and is
prothetic—if phonetic in this place. which is at least doubtful
——in atala (zlella, detractionis, 110. 7).

§59 o, K. Both these symbols express either a guttural or a
palatal roiceless stop. In our text the following words occur
with lt by the side of forms with initial e. ofly'rfer (abscisionis,
60. 2), yclyad (5. 14), dij (69. 1ο), beon yclyrlrle (29. 9)y
ly're (18. 4), lya (9. 17), lota (10. 16), loyaitol (47. 9), eto.

cis sometimes voiced: beyond (76. 4), [beneq (potus, 78. 1),
poclgaarlre (81. 10), perro-lay (84. 4), szoirryco (109. 3).

ε is represented by t in frete (37. 13) and ycfcrlaelcoa
(108. 13). For the rerer-se process, see (49 above, and for
the explanation, §63 below.

(60. As regards the pronunciation of this c, Ι have
already stated that it is either palatal or guttural. The
guttural pronunciation occurs of course before guttural vowels,
and possibly also in a few cases before purely palatal vowels
but only when thee is there owing to a secondary develop-
ment. T‘hus, when we find rc glosscd by Jsrfaee (33. 9), it
is difficolt to believe that the c, which has grown out of y,
and is thus a purely guttur-al stop, can be palatal in the
oblique cases. Before guttural rowels a palata] pronunciation
is not likely to have obtained.

661. What is the natiue of this palatalisation? Sievers
crpressly and distinctly states, in various sections of his
grammar, that the palatal c=trclr (ᾧ 196. 3), i. e. a ‘pronuncia-
tlon resembling the present English ea1’ (ᾧ 206, anm. 3).

¹ Sievers does not restrict his statement to any later period. The following
may therefore be of interest. That this assibilation ot the c cannot be
established for the older periorls-I here refer to the Corpus Glossary—may
bc seen from Dieter, ξ 43. who gives wertse (Wr. W.. 32. 25) as representing
