ιθιιιιι θιιιιθ (09 6), θιιθιιιθιιιθ (04 8), ιιθιιθι ιιθ (80 ι.) ,

§74 Intumuere. I begin niy notes on the inflections
by giving ιι oouple of instenees of the obsolute cases. They
are of 'course inritations from the Latin, and although not
restricted to inter1inear translatione, they are very frequent
there, owing to influenoe of the lemmata.

1 The uriling olene symbol instead of two.
